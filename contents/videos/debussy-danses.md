# Debussy - Danses sacrée et profane

*Masterclass in French impressionist harp technique*

Claude Debussy's "Danses sacrée et profane" represents a cornerstone of the harp repertoire, perfectly suited to the instrument's capacity for creating impressionistic soundscapes. This masterclass performance, recorded at the Paris Conservatory, showcases both technical mastery and deep understanding of French musical style.

## About This Performance

This recording captures Shamim during a public masterclass at her alma mater, the Conservatoire National Supérieur de Musique et de Danse de Paris. The performance includes both the sacred and profane dances, with detailed musical analysis and technical demonstrations.

### The Two Dances

**Danse sacrée (Sacred Dance)**
- Modal harmonies and ancient character
- Ethereal, otherworldly atmosphere
- Technical focus: controlled dynamics and timbral variations

**Danse profane (Profane Dance)**
- Sensual, flowing melodic lines
- Rich harmonic palette
- Technical focus: seamless arpeggios and melodic projection

## Debussy and the Harp

Composed in 1904, these dances were originally written for chromatic harp and string orchestra. Debussy's writing perfectly exploits the harp's natural resonance and ability to create atmospheric effects.
