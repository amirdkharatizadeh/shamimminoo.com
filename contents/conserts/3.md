# Contemporary Voices

This groundbreaking concert explores the cutting edge of harp repertoire, featuring world premieres alongside established masterworks of the contemporary canon.

## Featured World Premiere

**Jennifer Higdon - "Threads of Light" (2024)**  
*Commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic*

Grammy Award-winning composer Jennifer Higdon has created a stunning new work that explores the harp's percussive and melodic capabilities through extended techniques and innovative notation.

## Program Notes

The evening showcases how contemporary composers continue to expand the harp's expressive possibilities, from Ginastera's rhythmically complex language to Takemitsu's meditative soundscapes.

*"The harp in contemporary music serves as both ancient voice and future prophet."* - Program Notes
