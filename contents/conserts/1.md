# Harp Recital: Bach & Beyond

Join internationally acclaimed harpist Shamim Minoo for an evening of transcendent music that bridges centuries and styles. This carefully curated program explores the harp's capacity for both intimate chamber music and grand orchestral textures.

## Program Highlights

**J.S. Bach - Partita No. 2 in D minor**  
Originally composed for solo violin, this masterwork finds new voice through the harp's unique timbral possibilities.

**Claude Debussy - Danses sacrée et profane**  
A cornerstone of the harp repertoire, showcasing the instrument's ability to paint impressionistic soundscapes.

**Carlos Salzedo - Chanson dans la nuit**  
A haunting nocturne that demonstrates extended harp techniques and modern harmonic language.

This performance marks Shamim Minoo's New York debut at the prestigious Weill Recital Hall, following her Gold Medal victory at the 13th USA International Harp Competition.
